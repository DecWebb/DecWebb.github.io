excerpt: Timberwolf summer placement as Design Engineering Intern.

Worked in their engineering department where I recreated their TW190DHB wood chipper in SolidWorks from engineering drawings and Cobalt CAD programme models. 
Then modified components to change the engine from diesel to petrol to meet new legislation for engine type within the city centre of Paris.
